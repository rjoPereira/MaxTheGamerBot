# MaxTheGamerBot
A Discord bot made in Python with the objective of adding fun and several games to your server.
Currently it only has tictactoe wich can be runned in any channel, but my objective is to make:
-> TicTacToe that runs in a separate thread and only accepts input from the 2 players.
-> Hangman.
-> 4-in-a-row.
-> Cards Against Humanity.
-> Russian Roullete.
-> Warn when a game gets free.
-> Etc...
